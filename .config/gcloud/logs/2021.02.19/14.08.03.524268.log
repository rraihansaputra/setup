[m[1mGLOBAL FLAGS[m
     [1m--account[m=[4mACCOUNT[m
        Google Cloud Platform user account to use for invocation. Overrides the
        default [1mcore/account[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--billing-project[m=[4mBILLING_PROJECT[m
        The Google Cloud Platform project that will be charged quota for
        operations performed in gcloud. If you need to operate on one project,
        but need quota against a different project, you can use this flag to
        specify the billing project. If both [1mbilling/quota_project[m and
        [1m--billing-project[m are specified, [1m--billing-project[m takes precedence.
        Run [1m$ gcloud config set --help[m to see more information about
        [1mbilling/quota_project[m.

     [1m--configuration[m=[4mCONFIGURATION[m
        The configuration to use for this command invocation. For more
        information on how to use configurations, run: [1mgcloud topic
        configurations[m. You can also use the CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME
        environment variable to set the equivalent of this flag for a terminal
        session.

     [1m--flags-file[m=[4mYAML_FILE[m
        A YAML or JSON file that specifies a [1m--flag[m:[1mvalue[m dictionary. Useful
        for specifying complex flag values with special characters that work
        with any command interpreter. Additionally, each [1m--flags-file[m arg is
        replaced by its constituent flags. See $ gcloud topic flags-file for
        more information.

     [1m--flatten[m=[[4mKEY[m,...]
        Flatten [4mname[m[] output resource slices in [4mKEY[m into separate records for
        each item in each slice. Multiple keys and slices may be specified.
        This also flattens keys for [1m--format[m and [1m--filter[m. For example,
        [1m--flatten=abc.def[m flattens [1mabc.def[].ghi[m references to [1mabc.def.ghi[m. A
        resource record containing [1mabc.def[][m with N elements will expand to N
        records in the flattened output. This flag interacts with other flags
        that are applied in this order: [1m--flatten[m, [1m--sort-by[m, [1m--filter[m,
        [1m--limit[m.

     [1m--format[m=[4mFORMAT[m
        Set the format for printing command output resources. The default is a
        command-specific human-friendly output format. The supported formats
        are: [1mconfig[m, [1mcsv[m, [1mdefault[m, [1mdiff[m, [1mdisable[m, [1mflattened[m, [1mget[m, [1mjson[m, [1mlist[m,
        [1mmulti[m, [1mnone[m, [1mobject[m, [1mtable[m, [1mtext[m, [1mvalue[m, [1myaml[m. For more details run $
        gcloud topic formats.

     [1m--help[m
        Display detailed help.

     [1m--project[m=[4mPROJECT_ID[m
        The Google Cloud Platform project ID to use for this invocation. If
        omitted, then the current project is assumed; the current project can
        be listed using [1mgcloud config list --format='text(core.project)'[m and
        can be set using [1mgcloud config set project PROJECTID[m.

        [1m--project[m and its fallback [1mcore/project[m property play two roles in the
        invocation. It specifies the project of the resource to operate on. It
        also specifies the project for API enablement check, quota, and
        billing. To specify a different project for quota and billing, use
        [1m--billing-project[m or [1mbilling/quota_project[m property.

     [1m--quiet[m, [1m-q[m
        Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If input
        is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised.
        Overrides the default core/disable_prompts property value for this
        command invocation. This is equivalent to setting the environment
        variable [1mCLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS[m to 1.

     [1m--verbosity[m=[4mVERBOSITY[m; default="warning"
        Override the default verbosity for this command. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/verbosity[m property value for this command invocation. [4mVERBOSITY[m
        must be one of: [1mdebug[m, [1minfo[m, [1mwarning[m, [1merror[m, [1mcritical[m, [1mnone[m.

     [1m--version[m, [1m-v[m
        Print version information and exit. This flag is only available at the
        global level.

     [1m-h[m
        Print a summary help and exit.

[m[1mOTHER FLAGS[m
     [1m--impersonate-service-account[m=[4mSERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL[m
        For this gcloud invocation, all API requests will be made as the given
        service account instead of the currently selected account. This is done
        without needing to create, download, and activate a key for the
        account. In order to perform operations as the service account, your
        currently selected account must have an IAM role that includes the
        iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken permission for the service account.
        The roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator role has this permission or
        you may create a custom role. Overrides the default
        [1mauth/impersonate_service_account[m property value for this command
        invocation.

     [1m--log-http[m
        Log all HTTP server requests and responses to stderr. Overrides the
        default [1mcore/log_http[m property value for this command invocation.

     [1m--trace-token[m=[4mTRACE_TOKEN[m
        Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of
        issues. Overrides the default [1mcore/trace_token[m property value for this
        command invocation.

     [1m--user-output-enabled[m
        Print user intended output to the console. Overrides the default
        [1mcore/user_output_enabled[m property value for this command invocation.
        Use [1m--no-user-output-enabled[m to disable.
